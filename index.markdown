# See the world through the lens of mobile robots 
Are you curious about what the world looks like through the lens of a mobile robot? Do you want to play with your pets through an RC car in Augmented Reality with an iPhone, iPad, or Apple Vision Pro?

The Droid Vision app lets robot enthusiasts experience the world through the lens of mobile robots. Install the streaming service in the robot's Raspberry Pi and use this app to monitor activities around your house or check up on your pets.  

Please see my blog posts on how to set up the streaming service for your radio-controlled car. The app can be downloaded for free from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/droid-vision/id6737351549) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.modularmachines.droidvision&hl=en-US).
