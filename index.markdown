# See the world through the lens of mobile robots 
Are you curious about what the world looks like through the lens of a mobile robot? Want to interact with your pets via an RC car in Augmented Reality using an iPhone, iPad, or Apple Vision Pro?

The Droid Vision app allows robot enthusiasts to experience the world through the lens of mobile robots. Install the streaming service on your robot's Raspberry Pi and use this app to monitor activities around your house or check on your pets.

Please see my blog posts on building mobile robots or setting up the streaming service for your radio-controlled car. The app can be downloaded for free from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/droid-vision/id6737351549) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.modularmachines.droidvision&hl=en-US).
