I am always curious about how Roomba automatically creates a floor map of the house by driving around. In this article, I will explain how to create a floor map using a mobile robot with Nav2 SLAM Toolbox. 

# Get to know Nav2 SLAM Toolbox

The Nav2 SLAM Toolbox is a package in ROS 2 (Robot Operating System) used for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM); it enables a robot to create the map of an unknown environment while tracking its position on that map in real time. The map created is a 2D occupancy grid map for navigation later on.
