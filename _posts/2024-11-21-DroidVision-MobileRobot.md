## Introduction

In a previous post, we introduced the idea of live streaming from an RC Truck. That is fun. However, the RC truck is Radio-controlled, which means I cannot drive it remotely when I am away, and the car won't be able to drive autonomously. What if we can build a mobile robot and install the same streaming service there? That would be cool and more useful.
